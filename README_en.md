## ✨ Overview

**Halcyon** is an Android local music player built with **Jetpack Compose, Miuix, and AndroidX Media3**.

It focuses on local music and lyrics, with a MIUI / HyperOS-inspired interface, word-by-word lyrics, floating lyrics, status-bar lyrics, dynamic covers, an in-app equalizer, Monet dynamic color, online lyric matching, WebDAV / Navidrome / Emby remote libraries, LX Music API sources, library analytics, full app-data backup, and a highly customizable player experience.

## 🚀 Features

### 🎵 Library & Playlists

- Supports local MediaStore scanning and custom folder scanning, with browsing by album, artist, folder, genre, year, composer, and lyricist; long-press the scan button to trigger a deep full-tag rescan.
- Provides a dedicated library search page with song, album, artist, lyric, duplicate-song, and full-tag search, plus search history, multi-select, and range selection.
- Supports local playlists, favorites, five-star songs, playlist import / export, desktop shortcuts, and custom drag sorting.
- Album grouping uses both album name and album artist to avoid merging same-name albums from different artists.
- Includes library analytics, listening calendar, play-count ranking, listening-duration ranking, format distribution, and quality distribution.
- Library analytics are cached and prewarmed after scanning, so larger local libraries can open the statistics page faster.

### 🖼 Player UI & Dynamic Covers

- Provides an immersive lyric page, landscape lyric page, and landscape stacked-cover page.
- Supports dynamic video covers matched by song, album, or global fallback.
- Supports global custom wallpapers, launch posters, custom Hi-Res badges, and optional player button outlines.
- Supports Beautiful Lyrics-style dynamic backgrounds for the lyrics page, tablet landscape player, and landscape cover page, with speed, blur, and brightness controls.
- Supports Monet dynamic color derived from the system wallpaper or the current song cover.
- Non-immersive player covers can show a Hi-Res / MQ badge.
- The player supports pull-down dismissal, dynamic backgrounds, blurred cover backgrounds, cover swipe-to-skip, and landscape queue-cover switching; tablet landscape docks can show the current lyric.

### 🎤 Lyrics

- Supports LRC, Enhanced LRC, ELRC, TTML, AMLL TTML, and Lyricify lyric parsing.
- Supports word-by-word lyrics, translations, romanization / phonetics, background vocals, TTML duets, and ELRC V1/V2 duet tags.
- Reads embedded lyrics and external lyric files, including matching `.lrc`, `.ttml`, and `.elrc` files.
- Supports online lyric matching for local songs via Lyrico-compatible plugins: import / delete plugin bundles from zip files, configure plugin fields, and write results to embedded tags, `TTMLLYRIC`, or a `.lrc` file.
- Provides floating desktop lyrics, status-bar lyrics, media notification lyrics, lyric barrage, SuperLyricApi, and Lyric Getter API integration.
- Supports lyric card sharing, font import with a system-font picker, lyric offset, tap-to-seek, and secondary-line configuration.

### 🌐 WebDAV, Navidrome, Emby & LX Online Music

- Supports WebDAV remote libraries with connection testing, Digest authentication, remote browsing, and remote playback.
- Supports Navidrome / Subsonic and Emby music library entries with the same directory-browsing style as WebDAV.
- Supports LX Music API sources, online search, streaming playback, cover / lyric retrieval, and local downloads.

### 🎚 Audio Effects, Decoding, Tags & Quality

- Includes an in-app software 10-band parametric equalizer that does not depend on the system Equalizer, with bass boost and virtualizer shown based on device capability.
- Uses lyrico-audiotag as the primary local metadata path, supporting artwork, basic tags, embedded lyrics, and multi-value tags for common audio formats.
- The built-in tag editor supports editing basic tags, lyrics, and embedded artwork.
- Provides system, FFmpeg, and automatic decoding modes for better ALAC / AAC / M4A compatibility.
- Supports ReplayGain, shuffle queue restoration, quality labels, and 24-bit / 96 kHz recognition.
- Supports 163 key reading from standalone tags, Comment, and Description fields.

### 🎨 UI & Integrations

- Built with Miuix for a MIUI / HyperOS-inspired interface, including floating bottom navigation, MiniPlayer, blur / Liquid Glass effects, and unified sheets.
- Supports 12 interface languages, in-app language switching, GitHub update page, app logs, full app-data backup / restore, and Prism Music listening-history export.
- Supports song information, tag editing, lyric timing tools, external tag-editor adaptation, and AI song interpretation.
- Supports MediaSession custom commands for favorite and playback-mode controls in notifications / control centers.

### 🤖 AI & MCP

- Includes an MCP server built with the official Kotlin SDK, Ktor CIO, and Streamable HTTP, allowing MCP hosts such as Claude Desktop to control Halcyon playback.
- Enable it from Settings → MCP server, then connect to `http://<device-ip>:8384/mcp`.
- Available tools: `play_song`, `search_music`, `get_now_playing`, `skip_next`, `skip_previous`, `toggle_play_pause`, `toggle_shuffle`, `seek_to`, `get_queue`, and `get_library_stats`.
- Available read-only resources: `halcyon://playback/current` and `halcyon://library/stats`.
- The MCP server runs as an Android Foreground Service and stops when the setting is turned off.

## 📦 Download

Download the latest version from [Releases](https://github.com/Kifranei/Halcyon/releases).

Recommended first-time setup:

1. Install Halcyon.
2. Grant music file access permission and choose a scanning mode (media library scanning or custom folder scanning).
3. After scanning completes, the app is ready to use. To display lyrics on other pages, enable the option in the settings page.
4. Configure WebDAV manually if using a remote library.

## 🖼 Dynamic Video Covers

Dynamic video covers are used in the playback page cover area. Album-level configuration is recommended:

```text
Music/
├── Album Name.mp4
├── Song A.flac
├── Song B.flac
└── Song C.flac
```

or
```text
Music/Album Name Folder/
├── cover.mp4
├── Song A.flac
├── Song B.flac
└── Song C.flac
```

All songs in the same album can share the same video, avoiding duplicate video files for each song.

Centralized management is supported:

```text
Movies/Halcyon/DynamicCovers/
├── Album/
│   └── Album Name.mp4
├── Song/
│   └── Artist - Title.mp4
└── cover.mp4
```

Single-file configuration is also supported:
```text
Music/Song File Name.m4a
Music/Song File Name.mp4
```

Actual matching order depends on the implementation: it usually checks the song's local folder first, then checks DynamicCovers for song/album videos, and finally uses the global fallback video.

## 🛠 Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Halcyon.git
cd Halcyon
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Kifranei/Halcyon.git
cd Halcyon
.\gradlew.bat :app:assembleDebug -PellaAbi=arm64-v8a
```

Release builds prioritize the following environment variables:

```bash
RELEASE_STORE_FILE
RELEASE_STORE_PASSWORD
RELEASE_KEY_ALIAS
RELEASE_KEY_PASSWORD
```

If these variables are not set, the build uses `release.jks` in the project root. If no usable release keystore is available, the release build fails directly to avoid accidentally producing a release package signed with a debug key.

For daily development, use `assembleDebug` for validation. `fastRelease` / release builds are intended for release preparation only. Native libraries are packaged from prebuilt `.so` files by default; rerun the corresponding scripts only when updating FFmpeg or lyrico-audiotag native outputs. Push each completed commit to both GitHub and GitLab remotes.

---

## 🎧 Native Libraries

Prebuilt FFmpeg and lyrico-audiotag native libraries are located at:

```text
ffmpeg-decoder/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/libffmpegJNI.so
lyrico-audiotag/src/main/jniLibs/arm64-v8a/liblyrico_taglib.so
```

To restore FFmpeg prebuilt inputs after a fresh clone, run:

```powershell
.\scripts\download_ffmpeg_prebuilt.ps1
```

To update FFmpeg native outputs manually on Windows, run:

```powershell
.\build_ffmpeg.ps1
```

To update the lyrico-audiotag / TagLib native output, run:

```powershell
.\build_lyrico_taglib.ps1
```

Normal `assembleDebug` builds do not rebuild native code by default. Before release, verify the APK contains the required arm64-v8a `.so` files. For routine builds, the full FFmpeg source tree is unnecessary.

`liblyrico_taglib.so` is the native tag read/write output from lyrico-audiotag.
